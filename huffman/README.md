# Huffman encoder and decoder
![The GUI](https://github.com/fandahao17/data-structure/blob/master/huffman/GUI.png)

This is the lab project of my data structure course. We are asked to create a naive compression program using huffman code.My implementation is based on [hw7](https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw7/hw7) of Berkeley CS61B, and the algorithm is largely inspired by the [Princeton implementation](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/55compression/Huffman.java.html). The program can compress text files efficiently, though it doesn't perform well as for other file formats. 

The GUI shown above is adjusted from the [FileChooserDemo](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html) of the Oracle The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials.
